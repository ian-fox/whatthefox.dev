In the previous post we assumed that no signals or forks would happen in the child, but we didn't actually validate that. Let that be a lesson to us.\nLet's start by handling that unexpected child process. We'll move the syscall function that restarts the child to only come after an actual PtraceSyscall event, and add an arm for stopped children that tells us something is happening, but doesn't restart them:\n\nAt this point the process doesn't panic any more, but it does hang on that SIGCHLD. This is because the child didn't actually receive the signal! If we go back to our handy manual, we'll read the following:\n\nWhen a (possibly multithreaded) process receives any signal\nexcept SIGKILL, the kernel selects an arbitrary thread which\nhandles the signal.\n...\nIf the selected thread is traced, it enters signal-delivery-stop.\nAt this point, the signal is not yet delivered to the process,\nand can be suppressed by the tracer.  If the tracer doesn't\nsuppress the signal, it passes the signal to the tracee in the\nnext ptrace restart operation.  This second step of signal\ndelivery is called signal injection...\n\n...\n\nAfter signal-delivery-stop is observed by the tracer, the tracer\nshould restart the tracee with the call\n\n\nThere are a few notes on making sure you're catching the right signal, but it seems like the rust ptrace library is handling that for us. The result is that when we observe this stopped state, we actually need to pass the signal through to the child like so:\n\nAt this point the child program does actually run! If we try to run it with our config to block libprintf_wrapper though, we find that it fails to block the banned syscalls. This is because while we've dealt with the signal delivery, we're actually missing a large portion of the picture: we're still only tracing our immediate child!\n🔗Tracing multiple children\nRight now we're tracing our immediate child, but as soon as that child does a fork[^fork] the grandchildren are just running free. We need to start by telling ptrace that we want it to start tracing any new processes or threads our child creates. We can do this by changing what options we set on ptrace way back before we even start our child:\n\nBefore we had set EXITKILL, which would kill our descendants if we exited, and TRACESYSGOOD, which is used to distinguish signal delivery stops from syscall stops[^sysgood]. The new ones we've added tell ptrace that any time a tracee calls execve we want it to deliver us an event[^trace-exec], and that if a tracee fork, clone, or vfork we want it to start tracing the newly created process as well. This also means we have some new events to handle in our loop.\nPart of these settings is that ptrace will send a SIGSTOP to the newly created process, so if we see a fork, clone, or vfork happen we'll want to retrieve the new child's pid with getevent and make a note that next time we would inject a SIGSTOP to it, we should ignore it:\n\nWe also need to modify two other things. Our call to waitpid will change to waiting on None, which will get us events from all of our descendants instead of only our immediate child. And naturally, if we're getting events from our descendants, not every WaitStatus::Exited will mean we actually want to return! If a grandchild process exits we want to keep going.\nA simple solution to this is that waitpid will fail with ECHILD if we have no descendants, so we can modify our exit condition to look for that:\n\nThat was a lot! We can run child programs that use fork, vfork, and clone now[^edge-cases]!\n🔗Juggling memory maps\nThe final piece of the puzzle (for today at least) is that with multiple tracees we'll need multiple memory maps to keep track of them. Right now if we try to run our example program with the config forbidding libprintf_wrapper it probably won't block because we're only keeping track of the memory of one process. Depending on which child was last used to build the memory map, we may block or we may not! We can fix this by having a separate memory map per child[^sharing]:\n\nAt long last we can see the fruits of our effort! Note that the printf_wrapper call from all-in-one doesn't get caught, because that was the version where the function was statically compiled into the binary and thus it doesn't load the libprintf_wrapper.so. However as soon as we hit one of the other cases...\n\nBingo! We can even run things interactively, because we're not doing any input or output redirection:\n\nThere are still lots of details we've just sort of brushed over for the proof of concept, but it should be enough to try swapping the filtering layer out for eBPF. Tune in next time when we'll try that!\n\n[^fork] Or clone, or vfork.\n[^sysgood] This one we actually need to set for the rust ptrace library to work properly, otherwise it will always return SIGTRAP events instead of the nice PtraceSyscall events.\n[^trace-exec] Useful because otherwise when execve is called the tracee would receive a SIGTRAP, and we want to distinguish an exec from an actual SIGTRAP that we need to inject into the child.\n[^gdb] I at first tried with GDB, but for some reason the tracing didn't seem to work under it. My first thought was that since it was using ptrace itself that would interfere, but strace uses ptrace as well and it seems to work fine. In an effort to not get sidetracked we'll leave that as a mystery for another day.\n[^edge-cases] As always, ignoring some edge cases around things like proper error handling.\n[^sharing] Just like with many things in this proof of concept, there is probably lots of opportunity here for performance improvements by e.g. using some kind of copy-on-write data structure that would let us reuse the same map for all of the threads that are in the same child process.\n","id":"https://whatthefox.dev/posts/crabtrap-2/","title":"Crabtrap Part 2: Electric Boogaloo"},"https://whatthefox.dev/posts/crabtrap/":{"body":"I once read a blog post about the capabilities model in WASM, and specifically the idea that you can, when calling another module, give that module some subset of the capabilities you have. The idea being that if I'm, say, calling a function in a compression library, that function doesn't need to be able to talk on the network[1]. I was looking for a project to do to get back into OS-level programming (my job for the past few years has been very much the opposite of that) and thought it would be fun to try to implement something similar with binaries in Linux. The first part of that project is what this post is about.\nIf you just want to see the code, it's on github!\n🔗What are we building?\nThe core idea is a pretty simple one: seccomp-bpf is a system which allows you to restrict which syscalls[2] an application can make. It operates at the process level. We can get some more fine-grained information on where syscalls are coming from with tools like strace though; it has a --stack-trace flag which will, when it intercepts a syscall, trace the syscall all the way back up the stack.\nWe're going to combine these ideas to make a more fine-grained version of a seccomp-bpf-like system. The goal is to make something that will allow us to filter different sets of syscalls based on which code units within the process are making them. It's entirely possible that this has been done already, but because a quick search didn't turn anything up and the primary goal of this is to learn I'm not too concerned with reimplementing things.\nThe basic goal for our first proof of concept is simple: given a configuration profile and a binary, run the binary and filter syscalls based on what shared[3] object they originate from.\n🔗Nongoals\nFor this first step, there are a whole bunch of things we're not going to worry about:\n\nPerformance: for a first pass I decided to do a proof of concept fully in userland with ptrace. Since this will involve a lot of context switches we know it's going to be slow, but in future iterations I want to reimplement it with a kernel module and possibly with eBPF, if it proves strong enough.\nShared objects as the unit of code: I think in theory it should be possible to map out where the various parts of a statically compiled dependency end up in your code and filter based on that, but for the first pass we're only going to worry about whether a syscall originates from your binary directly, or goes through one (or more) shared objects on the way.\nOne architecture: anything dealing with syscalls is going to be architecture dependent. Since I'm doing this mostly as a proof of concept and learning project, I decided to implement it for aarch64[4].\nKill on violation: in theory we could fail the banned syscalls by modifying their return values. For now we'll just kill the child instead.\nMinimal error handling: for the first pass there's going to be a lot of .expects.\nSmall dependency graph: especially for a security-related program we'd like to keep our list of dependencies small. Again, since this is just a proof of concept, not going to worry about it.\nWe aren't going to worry about redirecting stdin, stdout, or stderr[5].\nIgnoring some edge cases: we'll come across some edge cases which will be possible to handle but at the cost of complexity. At least for the first pass we're going to ignore some of those and worry about them another time[6].\nNo grandchildren. For the proof of concept managing one child is enough.\n\nI'm also using this as an excuse to write some rust again, which is another thing I haven't used in a while. This also gives us a great pun-based naming opportunity: we're building a jail (or jail-like object at least) in rust, so we can call it \"crab trap!\"\n🔗A toy example\nWith those requirements set, let's get into the coding! The code for this post will live here if you want to follow along.\nThe first thing we'll need is a toy binary. We'll write a simple wrapper:[7]\nprintf_wrapper.c\n\nAnd a binary that calls write through both that and just through normal libc:\nstatic.c\n\nFor fun, we can also make one that loads the library dynamically:\ndynamic.c\n\nWe'll put it in a container to make sure we have a consistent environment:\n\nNow we've built three versions of our binary: two that load the shared object, and one that builds libprintf_wrapper in statically just as a point of comparison. Let's build make sure everything works:\n\nPerfect! This code is at the walkthrough-0 tag in the repository.\n🔗Interface and tests\nWe have one more thing to do before we get into the implementation: let's set up our desired interface and some tests. For the input we'll need some config to tell us which syscalls should be allowed or blocked (omitting the derives and uses for brevity):\n\nAnd for the output we'll want to get the process's standard out and error, and whether it exited normally or we killed it:\n\nFinally, the execute function itself:\n\nThe tests are pretty simple, we have one case where everything should go as normal (for now we'll fail open if a syscall isn't explicitly denied), and one where the child should get partway through before being killed:\n\nRunning cargo test gives us the output we expect: a panic at the todo!().\n🔗ptrace\nFor the proof of concept we're going use a tool called ptrace. ptrace is a piece of Linux which is used by debuggers to allow them to monitor (and change) the execution of another process. A very high-level overview of how it works (or at least how we'll be using it) is this:\n\nIn the child, we tell ptrace that we are expecting somebody to watch (\"trace\") us. The child will pause after doing this.\nIn the parent, we give ptrace some configuration to tell it how we want it to work.\nIn the parent, we tell ptrace to continue the execution of the child until the next time the child tries to make a syscall.\nWhen the child makes a syscall, the OS will pause it and wake our parent up to see what the parent wants to do about it.\nIn the parent, we can look at information about what state the child is in and what syscall it's trying to make, and then either tell ptrace to continue until the next syscall again, or kill the child.\n\nBy continuing this loop the child will keep executing, but every time it tries to do something the OS will pause and check with our parent process first. Eventually the child might call exit, and we can see that in the parent process as well and stop the loop.\n🔗Running the child process\nBefore we even start worrying about allowing or blocking syscalls, let's make sure we can execute a child process under ptrace. We'll start by forking[8]:\n\nIn the child we'll call traceme to wait for the parent, and then execve into our new life:\n\nMeanwhile in the parent we wait for the child, set up our ptrace options, and then enter the loop where we tell the child to continue until the next syscall or until we see it exit:\n\nAnd that's it! After running cargo test again we get the results we expected on the first try[9]! test_ok passes, and test_blocked fails because we haven't implemented that part yet. This code is at the tag walkthrough-1 in the git repo.\n🔗Getting a stack trace\nNow we're starting to get into the fun stuff! Our waitpid call will return with a WaitStatus::PtraceSyscall(pid) whenever our child enters or exits a syscall[10]. This is one of those things that if we were making a real system we would care about only checking on the enter side (in most cases), but for a proof of concept we'll just take the performance hit of checking every syscall twice.\nWe'll move the syscall handling itself out into a function. The first thing we'll want to do is grab the registers so that we can tell what syscall is happening and where the child is in its execution:\n\nNow we can start walking up the stack. If we look at the ARM docs we can see that the previous pc[11] is held in the link register (r30) and the pointer to the first stack frame is in r29[12]. The docs also tells us that at each stack frame we'll have a frame pointer which points to the previous stack frame (or 0 if we're at the base).\n\nFinally, the docs tells us that just above the frame pointer is the saved value of the previous link register. Now we can print that and then walk our way up by following the frame pointers until we hit the base of the stack:\n\nRunning this we do get lots of nice stack traces! Next up we need to map the pc locations to code units. This code is at the tag walkthrough-2.\n🔗Mapping to shared objects\nOur goal is in sight! The last thing we need to do is map our series of program counters back to the files they come from, and then use that to make a decision about whether to allow the syscall or not. We can get this information by looking in the proc filesystem. For instance, when I run cat /proc/self/maps I get the following:\n\nThis tells us which regions of memory are mapped to which files (as well as some other locations like the stack). By replacing self in the path with the PID of our child process, we can see the mapping for our child. For our purposes, what we care about are the first and second numbers which represent the location in memory that particular mapping lives at, and the final component which is (at least for the shared objects we care about) the path of the underlying file[13].\nLet's define some structs to help us with this:\n\nThis post is getting long as it is, so we'll skip the details of those. They're in the git repo in map.rs if you want to look at them in more detail. The important part is that MemoryMap exposes a function lookup&lt;'a&gt;(&amp;'a self, addr: u64) -&gt; Option&lt;&amp;'a str&gt; which will let us move from a program counter location to a path, if it's in our mapping.\nWe can create the map when the child gets execed into, and then pass it to our syscall handler:\n\nWe're passing it in as mutable because if we see a syscall that might modify the process memory we'll want to rebuild the map[^rebuild]. Let's handle that part first:\n\nFinally we have all the information we need!\n🔗Blocking syscalls\nThe final piece we need is to walk up the stack until we see a shared object we recognize that has a matching allow or deny rule for the current syscall, or we hit the base. We'll modify Config to handle this:\n\nPutting everything together, our handle_syscall function now looks like this:\n\nAnd if we run the tests we can see that with no restrictions both messages get printed and the child exits 0, but when we restrict the write syscall coming from libprintf_wrapper.so we only see the \"Hello from printf!\" before the child process gets terminated! Fantastic!\n\nThis code is at walkthrough-3.\n🔗Next steps\nWe've shown that the concept works. I think there are a few possible directions to go next, all of them exciting:\n\nProperly implement the signals, grandchildren, a proper command line interface, all the edge cases, etc. and then find a real example for some benchmarking to see exactly how bad the slowdown is with the naive implementation\nStart diving into one of the other implementations (investigate if some userland bookkeeping along with eBPF for the actual enforcement is possible, or a full-on kernel module)\nStart trying to map code units smaller than shared objects for dependencies that are statically compiled into a program\n\nI'm not sure which I'll tackle first, if you have any thoughts (or have just found this interesting) feel free to drop me an email any time!\n\n\n\nI looked a bit into how the xz backdoor worked and I'm not 100% sure that something as simple as this would have stopped it. Later on once I have a working sandbox I'll see if I can test that! ↩\n\n\nWhenever any program running on your computer wants to do something like read a file, open a network connection, it has to ask the operating system for permission. It does this by telling the OS what it wants to do, and then giving control to the OS. The OS will (after checking things like that the program is allowed to do what it's trying to do) carry out the request, and then return control to the program. ↩\n\n\nOne method of calling third party code is to use shared objects. We tell our code that we expect there to be a function with a certain name living in a certain shared object file, and then that file will be loaded into our process memory so that we can call the function. This can (very roughly) tell us where a piece of code came from. ↩\n\n\nThis is both because I'm on an ARM laptop, and because I've dealt with x86 assembly and calling conventions before but never ARM. This seemed as good a time as any to jump in! ↩\n\n\nOriginally I was using process::Command, which would have given me this for free. Unfortunately it seems like somewhere inside process::Command is an extra call to clone that I couldn't quite track, so we're going to roll our own for now. In a real application we'd maybe try to do some more debugging on that to get the nicer interface. ↩\n\n\nThe main one is signal handling. It seems like signals can be tricky with ptrace, and while I'm sure it's possible to handle nicely (debuggers must have some way of dealing with it) it's not particularly relevant to the concept we want to prove here. ↩\n\n\nI've never written production C code before. I'm sure there are all sorts of best practices that this isn't following. ↩\n\n\nClone is probably better practice, but this is a toy example for now and I like the word fork. ↩\n\n\nNot even close, but I've spared you all the silly mistakes. ↩\n\n\nFrom the ptrace man page: \"Syscall-enter-stop and syscall-exit-stop are indistinguishable from each other by the tracer. The tracer needs to keep track of the sequence of ptrace-stops in order to not misinterpret syscall-enter-stop as syscall-exit-stop or vice versa. In general, a syscall-enter-stop is always followed by syscall-exit-stop, PTRACE_EVENT stop, or the tracee's death; no other kinds of ptrace-stop can occur in between. However, note that seccomp stops (see below) can cause syscall-exit-stops, without preceding syscall-entry-stops. If seccomp is in use, care needs to be taken not to misinterpret such stops as syscall-entry-stops.\" ↩\n\n\n\"program counter\" - this is like a bookmark telling the child process what step of its instructions it's currently executing. It's how we'll be able to tell which piece of code is trying to make the syscall. ↩\n\n\nJust to verify, we can also check that the previous pc from r30 is the same as the link register when we go down one frame on the stack. ↩\n\n\nAs the doc points out, the pathname is potentially ambiguous when newlines are present or the underlying file has been deleted. I'm sure we could disambiguate this by looking at the inode instead, but that's beyond the scope of this proof of concept.\n[^rebuild] Unfortunately, because the \"files\" in the /proc/ filesystem aren't actually files, we can't just subscribe to get notified and rebuild the map any time it changes. This is a case where we actually would want to do the work at the syscall return, since the map wouldn't be updated until that point. ↩\n\n\n","id":"https://whatthefox.dev/posts/crabtrap/","title":"Crabtrap"},"https://whatthefox.dev/posts/executing-a-binary/":{"body":"This is the second post in a series. See the previous one here.\nThings are looking grim. We do not have much to work with. But there is still hope!\nOne thing you may have noticed if you're following along in the simulator is that once everything gets blown away, you still have your ssh connection, and you can still try to run commands. Most of them will reply with a command not found message, but at least something is still alive to print that!\nHow does that happen if we deleted everything?\n\nWhen you run a command like bash, Linux will go to the file on disk for the bash executable and load a copy of it into memory. From then on, the file isn't actually necessary. The information will stay in memory until the process ends, at which point you'd need to start it again by once again loading it from disk.\n🔗Examining the Landscape\nSo we deleted everything (well, most things, more on that later) from disk, but any processes which are still in memory will remain there for now. This includes our ssh connection (which is why we didn't immediately get kicked out), and our shell (which is the thing telling us command not found). If we exit our session we're going to have some serious problems, but at least for now we still have access to those.\nMost of the tools we'd normally use are gone, but we still have some options: the shell itself contains a few builtin commands which don't require calling an external binary. If we run help we can see what those are.\n\nBy the way, in these snippets the convention will be that if the prompt starts with $ we're inside the container in the lab environment (i.e. we are on the system which we accidentally blew up), and if the prompt starts with &gt; it will be commands running on a separate computer (such as the one we are running ssh from).\nAny commands not in that list (like ls or chmod) are not available to us. We have our shell builtins, but not much else. This is considerably fewer commands than we're used to having, but in combination with input and output redirection and some other shell magic it's enough to get us started.\nFor example, let's take stock of our surroundings. We can't use ls, but the shell has a feature that can help us here: globbing. In a shell command, a * gets expanded to the names of the files in a directory. So we can do the following:\n\nWe also have the ability to enter arbitrary text through our ssh connection, so that will be our method of sending data until we can get our hands on a copy of curl or wget or scp to do the heavy lifting of downloading the rest of the files we'll need (pasting through ssh is not the fastest).\nWe can also create files by redirecting the output of echo, like so:\n\nWhoops, we're still sitting at the root, and we don't have permission to write there. Fortunately we still have /tmp, and that is writable.\n\nExcellent! We can't see the contents right now, but at least we know it's there.\n🔗Hello, world!\nOur next step is going to be to figure out how to get a binary onto the server. If we can get that working, we'll be able to use it to add a copy of something like curl, and use that to download everything else we need.\nWe'll start with a simple \"hello world\" program to test our methodology, because we can probably make it pretty small (and as we'll see in the future this will turn out to be important):\n\nFor simplicity, let's assume for now that the system we're building this on is the same architecture as the server we're trying to rescue, meaning we don't have to worry about cross-compilation.\n\nHow can we get this file onto our server? Well, we have access to echo and we can redirect its output, so let's try that. We'll copy our binary onto our clipboard, and try to paste it in our terminal session. Moving raw binary around sounds tricky, so we'll encode it as text first. A common trick is to use base64, but we'd have trouble decoding it on the other end since we don't have a copy of base64 on the server to turn our encoded text back into binary.\nFortunately, echo has a -e flag which can help us. With -e, echo will turn several classes of escaped characters back into their proper formats. If we encode our file with one of the methods echo recognizes, we'll have no problem.\n\nEcho supports some shorthands like \\n for newline, but more importantly to us with \\x we can specify any binary byte. Let's glue some tools together to print our actual hello world in that format:\n\nThis will encode every byte of our file. There's one minor problem with this as written though, which is that the shell we're working with (in our simulator, at least) seems to have a limit on the size of line you can paste in. Even our small \"hello world\" binary is large enough that it won't fit if we put it all on one line.\nWe can try wrapping it in fold to solve this:\n\nBack in the simulator:\n\n🔗Running a Binary\nWe still have a hurdle to overcome in our world-saluting adventure. With no chmod, how can we run our fancy new program?\n\nLet's have a closer look at what all is available to us, maybe something still on the filesystem can help.\n\nIn another stroke of luck, we didn't blow away quite everything (that will be in a future blog post). We still have /lib. Let's see what's in there:\n\nWe still have a linker shared object! Can we call it?\n\nJackpot! If we check out the documentation, we'll see that by providing the following arguments, we can get it to execute our binary:\n\nNot quite! But at least we're still making progress. Let's figure out what went wrong.\n🔗Debugging\nLet's try our solution out back on our working computer where we have access to some more tools. First let's see if we even have the same file after it's gone through our process of encoding and decoding.\n\nWell that's not good. Maybe we can see what's going on in closer detail by running them both through xxd again to see where the difference is.\n\nThey look pretty similar, but there seems to be some extra stuff in the pasted version of the file. If we look carefully, we can see that every so often there's an extra 0a. Remember from earlier, that's ASCII for a newline! When we used fold to break up our binary into multiple lines, echo dutifully copied those newlines to the output, and broke our binary in the process.\nFortunately this is easy enough to fix, we'll just give each line its own echo command instead of doing it all at once. Normally echo outputs a newline at the end by itself (it just makes things cleaner for most uses), but we can suppress that with the -n flag. We also change our file redirection from &gt;, which would overwrite the file each time, to &gt;&gt;, which appends.\n\nNow we can copy the contents of commands.sh and paste it into our simulator:\n\nTime for the moment of truth!\n\nVictory! If you're following along in the simulator then I've added some tools to streamline the process under the solution-1 branch.\nIn the next instalments we'll use this to actually get a working system again, and then kick things up a notch by removing /lib.\n","id":"https://whatthefox.dev/posts/executing-a-binary/","title":"Executing a Binary"},"https://whatthefox.dev/posts/fast-forwarding-videos/":{"body":"Maybe you're like me and you have ADHD, and are allergic to watching videos at normal speed. Maybe you're looking to fast-forward through videos for some other reason. YouTube has options for 0.25x to 2x in increments of 0.25. But sometimes you want to go faster than that, or maybe you're watching on a different site that doesn't have those controls exposed.\nThere are probably browser extensions that do this, but it's pretty simple to implement ourselves. As a bonus it means you don't have to trust a random browser extension, in case you're paranoid like I am!\nIf you don't care about how this works or how you can explore stuff like this and just want to know what code to copy/paste to get these bookmarklets, skip to the end here.\n🔗Manipulating Videos with Javascript\nYour browser exposes the content of the webpage you're viewing to javascript code so that the code can make the page do useful things. We can write our own code to take advantage of this!\n\nIf we look at the element representing a video, we can see that it has a lot of attributes (they keep going well beyond what's in the screenshot). Of particular interest to us are the playbackRate and currentTime attributes. We can change these by assigning them new values:\n\nIf we leave a video running and mess around with this, we can confirm that changing playbackRate and currentTime do what we expect, great! Having to go through this whole process every time we wanted to change something would be a drag though. Fortunately we don't have to!\n🔗Bookmarklets\nWe can automate this process by putting it in a bookmarklet. We do that by putting our javascript in a bookmark where the URL would normally go, and it'll run when we click the bookmark. Maybe we could create a browser extension or something with a slightly nicer user interface, but that would also take more effort and I think this method is good enough for my purposes.\nIf we package our code up into a nice function like this:\n\nwe can copy/paste this into several bookmark definitions and change the 2 to something else to have buttons for various speeds we might commonly want.\n🔗Prompting the User\nIf you don't want a billion bookmarks clogging up your bookmark bar you could also prompt the user for their desired rate.\n\nThis lets us only have one bookmark, but does mean we need to type in the speed we want each time. I ended up finding that dedicated bookmarks for 1x, 2x, 2.5x, 3x, 3.5x, 4x and 8x were a good range of options for me. I can reset the video to normal speed with 1x if there's a complicated part, use the 2-4x depending how fast the people in the video talk, and use 8x to fast forward when looking for a specific piece.\nIf you don't enter a valid number the bookmarklet will throw an error, but since we're the only people who will be using this we aren't too worried about that. If you really wanted to you could add some checks and alert the user if they entered something that wasn't valid.\n🔗Final Result (TL;DR)\nCopy the following code into a bookmark's URL field to make a button which will set the speed of all videos on a webpage to 2x. Change the number before saving to create one that sets it to a different speed. Maybe make multiple if you want e.g. one button to 2x speed, one to 3x, and one to go back to normal (1x).

What is the probability that the needle will lie across a line between two boards?\nHe solved it with some fancy calculus, which is a fine way of doing it, but not particularly satisfying to me. However in 1860 a man named Joseph-Émile Barbier came up with this super slick proof, which is without a doubt the coolest proof I've ever seen.\n\nThe trick is that rather than trying to calculate the probability directly, Barbier examined it through the lens of the expected number of lines the needle would cross.\nSuppose we define our boards to be 1 unit of distance wide, and we find that dropping a needle of length 1 unit has a probability $p$ of crossing one of the lines. We will ignore the possibility of the needle being exactly along a line, or having one end each on precisely two lines, since the probability of those is 0.\nIf we drop one needle $n_1$, our expected number of crossings is simply $p$, the probability that the needle crosses a line.\nIf we drop a second needle $n_2$, then by linearity of expectation we find that our expected total number of crossings is\n$$E(n_1+n_2)=E(n_1)+E(n_2)=2p$$\nIn general, the expected number of crossings when you drop $m$ needles is $mp$.\n\n  \n  \n    Figure 1: Two needles on the floor\n  \n\nSimilarly, if we drop a needle $n$ and break it into $m$ identical pieces $n_1 \\ldots n_m$ we find that each piece must be responsible for the same expected number of crossings:\n$$E(n) = \\sum_{i=0}^{m}E(n_i) \\implies E(n_i)=\\frac{1}{p}$$\nIn short, we can drop a needle of any length $\\ell$ we want and the expected number of crossings will be $\\ell p$. This holds even if we drop some really bizarre needles:\n\n  \n  \n    Figure 2: Some strangely shaped needles indeed\n  \n\nNow suppose we take a needle and bend it into a circle of diameter 1. We know that the expected number of crossings must be $\\pi p$ from before. But consider the ways the needle could fall on the floor:\n\n  \n  \n    Figure 3: Three needles, bent into circles\n  \n\nIt always crosses in exactly two places! So $\\pi p=2$ and we find that $p=\\frac{2}{\\pi}$. Any straight needle we drop on the floor will have probability $\\frac{2\\ell}{\\pi}$ of crossing a line. And we didn't do a single bit of calculus!\n","id":"https://whatthefox.dev/posts/favourite-proof/","title":"A satisfying proof"},"https://whatthefox.dev/posts/oh-no-my-binaries/":{"body":"My beautiful binaries! (With apologies to Eric Rosen)\nYesterday a friend came to me with a problem. While managing some backups, he accidentally deleted /bin, /boot, /dev, /tmp, /srv, /usr, and /opt from the filesystem itself instead of the backups.\nThis left an interesting problem: without the binaries from /bin and /usr, it was impossible to do almost everything you normally do. Picture the situation. You do not have a head or a tail, let alone an entire cat! No chmod, certainly nothing fancy like curl or sshd. If you listen closely though, you might hear an echo...\n\nThe stakes were somewhat low, because there were backups, but he would have to make a 200km trip in order to get to the server and apply them. Perhaps if we were clever, we could avoid that and repair the system just from our ssh connection.\nThe answer will turn out to be very interesting, and we'll learn some fun things about Linux in the process!\nIf you want to follow along through this, I've created a container-based lab environment which we can use to test our techniques here.\nWhen you're ready, check out the next part here!\n","id":"https://whatthefox.dev/posts/oh-no-my-binaries/","title":"Oh no, my binaries!"}},"docInfo":{"https://whatthefox.dev/":{"body":25,"title":2},"https://whatthefox.dev/posts/":{"body":0,"title":1},"https://whatthefox.dev/posts/crabtrap-2/":{"body":613,"title":5},"https://whatthefox.dev/posts/crabtrap/":{"body":1401,"title":1},"https://whatthefox.dev/posts/executing-a-binary/":{"body":649,"title":2},"https://whatthefox.dev/posts/fast-forwarding-videos/":{"body":360,"title":4},"https://whatthefox.dev/posts/favourite-proof/":{"body":235,"title":2},"https://whatthefox.dev/posts/oh-no-my-binaries/":{"body":101,"title":2}},"length":8},"lang":"English"}
